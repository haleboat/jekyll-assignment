Our clients include owners, developers, contractors and subcontractors. Whether it's a residential, commercial or industrial project, our team is dedicated to helping you keep it on budget and on schedule. Our approach is to limit or avoid disputes by focusing on contract negotiations and dispute resolution mechanisms, and by advising on rights and obligations throughout the construction process. Where disputes are unavoidable, we help you achieve the best possible outcome through mediation and litigation.
