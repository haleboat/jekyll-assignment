We understand that many business issues impact the way litigation must be conducted and we adapt the legal strategy to
match your goals. We recognize that many clients wish to avoid trial and our team of experienced litigators will work
with you, using alternative dispute resolution methods and other appropriate innovative measures, to develop a
strategy that best meets your business objectives and will result in practical solutions to complicated problems.

It is not always possible to conclude litigious matters amicably. We have extensive experience pursuing matters
through trial and have established a reputation for aggressively and thoroughly pursuing our clients' interests at
every level of Canada's judicial system when necessary, all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada.

Our extensive use of paralegals, litigation support, e-discovery and document imaging technology enables us to provide
cost-effective service to our clients on disputes of all sizes.
