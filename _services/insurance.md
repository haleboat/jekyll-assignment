The lawyers in our Insurance & Risk Management Practice Group are an experienced team of lawyers who represent major
Canadian and international insurers, brokers, syndicates, adjusters, corporations, individuals and self-insuring
organizations.

Over the years, our firm has developed a top-notch team of lawyers and skilled litigation support staff who truly
understand the legal and business needs of our clients, both institutional insurers and self-insured corporations.
They have a well-earned reputation for aggressively and thoroughly pursuing your interests at every level of the
Canadian judicial system and through a variety of alternative dispute resolution approaches.

We recognize you may see trial as an absolute last resort and where possible we use innovative, alternative dispute
resolution methods such as judicial dispute resolution, private mediation and pre-trial settlement conferences to
reach a timely and cost-effective solution.

In addition, we have vast experience in assisting with the development and operation of programs for self-insured
organizations.

We have a solid appreciation of the expectations and requirements of insurers, in relation to standardized, timely
