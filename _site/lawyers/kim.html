      <h1>Kim</h1>
      <p>Labour and Employment Lawyer, Kim Nutz holds a Bachelor of Arts in American History and a Bachelor of Laws from the
  University of Calgary (1999). She was admitted to the Alberta bar in 2000 and initially articled at a small criminal
  defence firm. After completing her articles, Kim moved to a large national firm as an associate lawyer for 6 years
  where she began working and specializing in labour &amp; employment law and commercial litigation. She then joined the
  City of Calgary as legal counsel to the Calgary Fire Department further specializing in labour &amp; employment law and
  spent a short time at Suncor Energy in their law department.</p>

<p>Kim practices primarily in the area of labour and employment law representing both employees and employers. As a
  labour &amp; employment lawyer, Kim’s practice includes working with employers and employees in wrongful termination
  matters and human rights disputes. She drafts and reviews severance packages and employment agreements, conducts and
  advises on workplace investigations (including OHS post incident investigations), and assists employers to develop
  workplace policies to comply with occupational health and safety, employment standards, privacy and human rights
  legislation. Kim helps clients know the difference between minimum standards and what is really required under the
  common law with respect to employment law.
  When acting for a terminated employee, Kim offers a flat rate fee for the severance review and if deemed necessary,
  after the review is complete, will further act on behalf of the employee on a contingency basis for negotiations on
  the severance package. This means that the client will only pay the upfront flat fee plus the contingency fee on any
  increase negotiated on the severance package they ultimately receive. This limits a person’s risk at a time when
  finances may be of greater concern.
  Additionally, Kim can assist in any real estate purchase, sale or refinance transactions and is also a licensed
  mortgage broker. In her spare time, Kim is also a wife and mom to two great kids!</p>
